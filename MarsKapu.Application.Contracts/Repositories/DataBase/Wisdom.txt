Every end is a beginning.
Dont't judge a book by it's cover.
Strike while the iron is hot.
Honesty is the best policy.
The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
Better late than never.
Rome wasn’t built in a day.
Actions speak louder than words.
Still waters run deep.
Out of sight, out of mind.
Easy come, easy go.
You can’t make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.
The forbidden fruit is always the sweetest.
Learn to walk before you run.
It’s better to be safe than sorry.
Where there’s a will, there’s a way.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
A stitch in time saves nine.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Those in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones.
Always put your best foot forward.
